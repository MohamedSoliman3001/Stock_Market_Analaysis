##### get data for 3 months later:

## set start date 3 months later
start_date = datetime.now() - pd.DateOffset(months=3)

## set end date in now
end_date = datetime.now()

## choose a companies for study
Companies = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'GOOG']

## Create a list of them

df_list = []

## Set the list by the company and date (Company Name, Start and End Date)
for Company in Companies:
  data = yf.download(Company, start=start_date, end=end_date)
  df_list.append(data)

df = pd.concat(df_list, keys=Companies, names=['Company', 'Date'])
print(df.head())

## reset Index
df = df.reset_index()
print(df.head())

##### Performance in the stock market of all the companies:
fig = px.line(df,
              x='Date',
              y='Close',
              color='Company',
              title="Stock Market Performance for the Last 3 Months")

fig.show()

##### compare the performance of different companies and identify similarities or differences in their stock price movements:
fig = px.area(df,
              x='Date',
              y='Close',
              color='Company',
              facet_col='Company',
              labels={
                'Date': 'Date',
                'Close': 'Closing Price',
                'Company': 'Company'
              },
              title='Stock Prices for Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google')
fig.show()

##### analyze moving averages:
## create averages:

df['MA10'] = df.groupby('Company')['Close'].rolling(
  window=10).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)
df['MA20'] = df.groupby('Company')['Close'].rolling(
  window=20).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)

for Company, group in df.groupby('Company'):
  print(f'Moving Averages for {Company}')
  print(group[['MA10', 'MA20']])

##### visualize the moving averages of all companies:
for Company, group in df.groupby('Company'):
  fig = px.line(group,
                x='Date',
                y=['Close', 'MA10', 'MA20'],
                title=f"{Company} Moving Averages")
  fig.show()

#  The output shows four separate graphs for each company. When the MA10 crosses above the MA20, it is considered a bullish signal indicating that the stock price will continue to rise. Conversely, when the MA10 crosses below the MA20, it is a bearish signal that the stock price will continue falling.

##  Analyze the volatility of all companies:
df['Volatility'] = df.groupby('Company')['Close'].pct_change().rolling(
  window=10).std().reset_index(0, drop=True)
fig = px.line(df,
              x='Date',
              y='Volatility',
              color='Company',
              title='Volatility of All Companies')
fig.show()

# High volatility indicates that the stock or market experiences large and frequent price movements, while low volatility indicates that the market experiences smaller or less frequent price movements.

##### analyze the correlation between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft
## create a DataFrame with the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft
apple = df.loc[df['Company'] == 'AAPL',
               ['Date', 'Close']].rename(columns={'Close': 'AAPL'})
microsoft = df.loc[df['Company'] == 'MSFT',
                   ['Date', 'Close']].rename(columns={'Close': 'MSFT'})
df_corr = pd.merge(apple, microsoft, on='Date')

##  create a scatter plot to visualize the correlation
fig = px.scatter(df_corr,
                 x='AAPL',
                 y='MSFT',
                 trendline='ols',
                 title='Correlation between Apple and Microsoft')
fig.show()

# There is a strong linear relationship between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft, which means that when the stock price of Apple increases, the stock price of Microsoft also tends to increase. It is a sign of a strong correlation or similarity between the two companies, which can be due to factors such as industry trends, market conditions, or common business partners or customers. For investors, this positive correlation may indicate an opportunity to diversify their portfolio by investing in both companies, as both stocks may offer similar potential returns and risks
